## :trident: About

This project has been one of the most challenging to put together due to the vast amount of pieces necessary to work appropriately.

This student platform is made up of a chat, a file uploader, a section to showcase the grades of a student in the student's profile, a PDF viewer, and a part to enter the student's grades.

## :green_book: Usage

* Below is an example of how a student would log in and what the index page looks like on both student and teacher profiles:

* Below showcases how the chat works:
  
> **Note:** The students must be enrolled in the same program to see and chat with each other on the chat.

* Each student will be able to upload the document before the deadline.

When it comes to the profile of the teacher, they will only be able to enter grades and read the documentation uploaded by the students of a module they are currently teaching.

* Teachers can enter grades for selected students in real-time as shown below:

> **Note:** Teachers are only able to change the grades that have not been entered.
